<h2>Books</h2>

<div class="resource">
<h3><a class="resrcLink" href="https://learningwebdesign.com/">Learning web design</a></h3>
<p>Our green book, describing the basics of basics. The book has a very slow pace, explains the history behind the web before you even start learning how to code.
The book is filled with exercises, you can download the materials from the website. You can also find links to some additional readings if you are interested.
I find this book great, it can explain difficult terms and concepts very easily, although sometimes I find the book a  bit confusing. It seems like it tries to simplify everything a bit too much sometimes.</p>

<h2>Online tutorials</h2>
<div class="flex">
<div class="resource">
<h3><a class="resrcLink" href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a></h3>
<p>The website I use the most. Everything I 've learnt so far comes from W3Schools. I find it great, it fits my pace and provides a lot of exercises.
However, sometimes they introduce a new code and don't explain it. Or they explain some more challening concepts very very briefly. Fortunately, it doesn't happen too often.
I appreaciate this website for giving access to PLENTY of tools, exercises and tests!</p>

<h3><a class="resrcLink" href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/">freeCodeCamp</a></h3>
<p>Not gonna lie, I didn't like this one at first at all! But once I learned some basics on W3Schools, freeCodeCamp became a great way to practice coding!
I still think that they oversimplified every single possible thing and that was the reason I had no idea what they wanted me to do and what I was doing.
However, it still serves as a good platform for practice and I come back to it from time to time.</p>
