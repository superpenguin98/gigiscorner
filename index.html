<p>Did you like tiny Kirby in the previous post? It's so cute, right? I didn't mean for it to be on the border but it looks so adorable. I'll keep it this way.</p>
<p>Yesterday I learned more about tables and I think now I feel ready to make one by myself.</p>
<p>I will show you my current skincare routine because I am forever in my skincare era:</p>

<p>Some of the rows are marked blue here. This colour means that I use the product in the evening and/or only a few times a week, not daily!</p>
<p>How is it? For some reason, I have problems with tr:hover thing... Only some of the rows change the colour when I hover, I have no idea how to fix it.</p>

<p>New month, new challenges! I decided to move back to HTML since I couldn't really understand the topic about tables in CSS.</p>
<p>Idk, should I add one here? Maybe later!</p>
<p>Today I learned about creating an image map and a bit about the <picture> element.</p>
<p>I wanted to create an image map now but I realised that I have no idea how to find the coordinates on my pictures. What should I do?</p>
<p>Sometimes I find these tutorials a bit lacking... or too extensive for the level?</p>
<p>Why do they start mentioning JavaScript already when I'm still at the beginning of HTML and CSS tutorials?</p>
<p>Anyway... here is the promised button:</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/C-u5WLJ9Yk4?si=AakaUqoF32wc0uzi" target="_blank">Click!</a></p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>OMG now all links turned into buttons! Crazy. But it's ok :) <img src="kirby.png" alt="Kirby" style="width:100px;height:100px;float:right;"></p>

<div class="post">
<p><b>29th November</b></p>
<p>OMG! It's been a month since I started learnig HTML and CSS. I can't believe it. Time really flies. How is my progress? Did I learn a lot in one month?</p>
<p>I had a short trip to Wroclaw to visit Christmas market and the garden of lights. It was great but I am still sick :( </p>
<p>Anyway... I am back and learned new things!</p>
<p>On <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_link.asp">W3Schools</a>,  I read chapters about customising links, making buttons and about lists.</p>
<p>When I will be suddenly on motivation high, I'll add some buttons here. Although I don't know yet what I should even link here.</p>
<p>For now, I just wanted to write what I did today! So it looks like I'm a productive bitch.</p>
</div>
<div class="post">
<p style="border: 2px dashed purple;"><b>26th November</b></p>
<p>I'm visiting Christmas market in Wroclaw soon and I won't be able to learn or update here for a few days. That's why I am learning a lot now.</p>
<p>Today I learned about <span> element and it was exactly what I was looking for! I have been reading about google fonts and icons today. I had no idea that using icons can be kinda complicated lol...</p>
<p>I've started organising the code a bit as well... To be clear, I won't change the very first ones because this is how I started. Now I am improving and I hope you can see it in the lastest lines.</p>
<p>Anyway, I hope to have a lot of fun with google fonts and their effects. Especially the example with Sophia on fire is wild.</p>
<p>I don't have an idea yet on how to use icons for now. Maybe I should use them like emojis? Idk idk...</p>
</div>
<div class="post">
<p style="border: 2px dotted red;"><b>25th November</b></p>
<p>I was feeling terrible these past days but I am getting better. It's time for a new post on Gigi's corner.</p>
<p>I have learned a lot about formatting text and about fonts. I know what fallback fonts are and I am thinking on applying them here. I just need to learn how to use my super aesthetic fonts first before I decide on other totally basic fonts lol</p>
<p>Another interesting thing I learned is white-space property. I didn't get it at first but I asked ChatGPT and it explained me better.</p>
<p>Understanding font-variant: small-caps was also confusing. But now I kinda get it? Anyway, it seems that lora doesn't support it, I guess? So it's not use using it here.</p>
<p>What else should I write? I don't know, I feel like I don't make big progress. But I know that even small steps are important.</p>
<p>Damn, I don't like this background. I think I'll change it again.</p>
</div>
<div class="post">
<p><b>20th November</b></p>
<p>I thought I'm completely healed but today I feel sick again. My throat is hurting and I'm feeling so cold!</p>
<p>I'm not stopping thought and keep learning!</p>
<p>I just finished chapters about margins, padding, height and width, and learned what Box Model is.</p>
<p>I am still focusing on <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">W3Schools.</a> I am also reading a green book.</p>
<p>I changed the background of the website. Is it better now? I don't know anymore. Previous one was such bad quality but <em>cozy</em> in some way?</p>
<p>I tried making the borders a bit rounder. Does it look nicer now?</p>
</div>
<div class="post">
<p><b>18th November</b></p>
<p>I've just finished the chapter about CSS backgrounds and decided to play a bit with it.</p>
<p>I added a picture I found on google and set it as the background.</p>
<p>I tried to find a good quality picture but in the end, it looks so terrible??</p>
<p>Anyway, it was not so easy and I had to go back to the materials a few times. It's a good practice though!</p>
<p>I just don't have the slightest idea how I can keep practicing these? Should I make different backgrounds for each post?</p>
<p>Should I change the border for each post as well? But then setting the selector previously doesn't make much sense anymore...</p>
<p>I'll think about it.</p>
<p><b>PS.</b> I added a small bear gif at the top. Do you like it?</p>
</div>
<div class="post">
<p><b>16th November</b></p>
<p>How is it looking now?</p>
<p>I decided to move to CSS for now. I find it interesting and I want to make my website pretty!</p>
<p>I'm thinking of adding a cozy silly picture as the background and making the posts a bit transparent like now.</p>
<p>There is a small break between the posts here because I was out and had no access to my laptop, so now I'm reviewing a bit.</p>
<p>Today's CSS chapter is about backgrounds. I know a bit from the HTML course already but it will help me refresh my memory and learn something new!</p>
<p>To be honest, I find CSS selectors a bit hard to understand, especially id selector, but I hope I learn using them with time.</p>
<p><b>Small update:</b> I've gone through background-color, background-image, background-position and background-repeat today.<br>
<b>Next time:</b> background-attachment and background shorthand property whatever that is!</p>
<p> Song of the day: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyw_vrI4ySg">Killin' Me Good</a></p>

<p><b>8th November</b></p>
<p>Update: I guess I kinda figured it out? Does it look better now?</p>
<p>I tried to make the whole page look like this but it turned to be one huge mess! I don't know...</p>
</div>
<p style="border:2px solid Black; text-align:center; background-color:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5); font-family:lora;"> <b>7th November</b><br>Another entry after some time of absence. Yesterday evening I was reading about colours and borders. That's why this entry is made in this way. Do you like it?<br>
I just wish I knew how to make the border a bit shorter on the sides? Right now it's stretched on the whole page.<br>
Which way of writing entries is better? This one or the old one?<br>Now I feel like I can customise the shit out of this page, I'm such a <mark>profi</mark>!<br>
Another thing I need to learn: how to charge colours of some chosen letters within this one paragraph code?<br>
So far I think I'm doing <mark>good?</mark> Here I'm dropping meme of the day:<br>
<img src="pinterestmeme.jpg" width="300" height="300" alt="Some pinterest meme about academia girl"> </p>
<p style="background-color:white; text-align:center; font-family:cursive"><b>3rd November</b></p>
<p style="font-family:lora;">My third entry so far. Today I have learned about formatting.<br>However, I find certain elements a bit confusing. For example:</p>
<p style="font-family:lora;"><b>This sentence is bold and bald.</b><p>
<p style="font-family:lora;"><strong>And this one is super important. What's the difference? It looks the same.</strong></p>
<p style="font-family:lora;"><i>This sentence is Italian.</i></p>
<p style="font-family:lora;"><em>And this one is emphasised?</em></p>
<p style="font-family:lora;">Omg! <small>This sentence is so tiny!</small> It's not like other sentences.<mark>What a pick me.</mark></p>
<p style="font-family:lora;"> Ok, I am running out of <del>ideen</del><ins>ideas</ins> for <sup>these</sup><sub>sentences.</sub></p>
<p style="font-family:lora;">What should I write about? Should I keep making <mark>daddy jokes?</mark></p>
<p style="font-family:lora;">These entries are so chaotic omg but I don't know what else I should do to practice all of these.</p>
<p style="font-family:lora;">I think I might be able to finish reading <cite>Schwarze Magnolie</cite> by Hyeonseo Lee today.</p>
<img src="./36f88735e488ab338dd8fc87bc0a23b5.jpg" width="300" height="300" alt="Meme I'm not like other girls">
<p style="font-family:lora;">Next thing I have learned are quotations, like here:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://2l.pl/artykul-31268.html">
Koniec i bomba. A kto czytał ten trąba. W. G.
</blockquote>
<p style="font-family:lora;">And here I am inserting <q>quotation marks</q>.</p>
<p style="font-family:lora;">It's a lot of information at once but learning <abbr title="Hypertext Mark-up Language">HTML</abbr>is actually kinda fun! Btw...</p>
<bdo dir="rtl" style="font-family:lora;">Look at this crazy sentence lol</bdo>

<p style="background-color:white; text-align:center; font-family:cursive">2nd November</p>
<p style="font-family:lora;">This is my second entry while documenting my IT journey. Here is what I've learned today:</p>
<p style="color:blue;"> This sentence is blue.</p>
<p style="font-family:arial;"> This sentence is written with Arial font.</p>
<p style="font-size:200%; font-family:lora"> And this sentence is bigger. Isn't it?</p>
<p style="font-family:lora;">Move your mouse over the title of this page to see something.</p>
<p style="font-family:lora;">Here is a poem I have recently found:</p>
<pre>
Lubię, kiedy kobieta omdlewa w objęciu,
Kiedy w lubieżnym zwisa przez ramię przegięciu,
Gdy jej oczy zachodzą mgłą, twarz cała blednie,
I wargi się wilgotne rozchylą bezwiednie.

Lubię, kiedy ją rozkosz i żądza oniemi,
Gdy wpija się w ramiona palcami drżącemi,
Gdy krótkim, urywanym oddycha oddechem,
I oddaje się cała z mdlejącym uśmiechem. 

I lubię ten wstyd, co się kobiecie zabrania
Przyznać, że czuje rozkosz, że moc pożądania
Zwalcza ją, a sycenie żądzy oszalenia,
Gdy szuka ust, a lęka się słów i spojrzenia. 

Lubię to — i tę chwilę lubię, gdy koło mnie
Wyczerpana, zmęczona leży nieprzytomnie,
A myśl moja już od niej wybiega skrzydlata
W nieskończone przestrzenie nieziemskiego świata.
</pre>
<p style="font-family:lora;">It's written by one of my favourite Polish poets - Kazimierz Przerwa-Tetmajer.</p>
<p style="font-family:lora;">Currently vibing to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hz2aCKe8G8A">this song.</a> </p>

<p>This is my first paragraph. I am learning about HTML right now and I think I am enjoying it so far. </p>
<p>I will be updating this page with time after learning more.</p>
<p>For the purpose of my fancy rich bitch IT journey, I am using <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">this website.</a> </p>
