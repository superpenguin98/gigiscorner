<h3>2nd May</h3>
<p>It's so tiring. No resource can explain basic JavaScript well enough.</p>
<p>W3Schools is the worst so far. One sentence explanations and they call it a day?</p>
<p>Green book is a bit more helpful but still lacking sometimes.</p>
<p>Just understanding, how loops work, took me a lot of time. I wanted to do exercises from the book as well but I can't even grasp what the author actually wants me to do.</p>
<p>So much time and I still can't write anything because I can't understand how it all works and connects to each other.</p>
<p>I'll try with YouTube tutorials for dummies. Maybe they'll be better...</p>
<p>In the meantime, I am learning SASS. It's connected to CSS, so it should be a bit easier for me.</p>
<p>I'm just irritated that no resourse can be good enough. It almost feels that you need to have some knowledge before you can even start with the basics?</p>
<p>Or maybe IT people are just bad teachers, lol.</p>
</div>
<div class="post">
<h3>19th April</h3>
<p>Wow, long time without an update!</p>
<p>At the very last day of March I finally got the CSS certification. I am getting closer to my small goal!</p>
<p>The CSS exam was harder than I expected but I think I did well anyway. I scored 61 out of 70 points.</p>
<p>Now that I rested a bit, I can try with JavaScript again.</p>
<p>It's a bit like a love-hate relationship though. It's getting so complicated!</p>
<p>However, I started reading the JavaScript chapter in the green book and now it doesn't seem THAT complicated anymore?</p>
<p>Of course, there's a lot of new things and it's a bit overwhelming but with this book, it's not so bad like it used to be...</p>
<p>I hope I'll tame JS as well as HTML and CSS! Wish me luck!</p>
</div>
<div class="post">
<h3>24th March</h3>
<p>Hi! Long time no see!</p>
<p>I have been studying diligently for the past days for the certification exam.</p>
<p>I already went through 12 out of 16 modules, so I am really really close.</p>
<p>However, things are taking a bit longer than I expected. I wanted to get the certification until the end of the month, but it may be very tight.</p>
<p>I'm not in a hurry, it's just my personal deadline I wish I could meet. But it's ok if I can't.</p>
<p>CSS can be pretty complicated at times. I enjoy, however, how many things you can do with it.</p>
<p>I applied flexbox model in the menu at the top of the website. Just to practice the properties etc.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if it changed anything but at least I practiced. It's actually fun.</p>
<p>Maybe I should slowly start copying websites' layouts for practice too?</p>
<p>I'm really lacking ideas haha</p>
</div>
<div class="post">
<h3>10th March</h3>
<p>I am getting so advanced with CSS. But I feel like I forget everything the moment I turn the laptop off...</p>
<p>What should I do? More practice? I guess so?</p>
<p>The menu looks so messy right now. How can I clean this up? How to make it more organised?</p>
<p>So many questions and no answers!</p>
<p>I'm thinking of making an animation with CSS but what should I make it do?</p>
<img src="kirby.png" class="animkirby">
<p>What about this? Isn't it cool? OMG! I can't believe I can do such things!</p>
<p>Today I've also learned about tooltips but the explanation was so messy... I don't think I get it.</p>
</div>
<div class="post">
<h3 id="March">4th March</h3>
<p>Good afternoon in the new month! I can't wait to see how much I can accomplish in March.</p>
<p>I hope it will be as productive as the previous months. I am slowly getting closer to that CSS certification.</p>
<p>4/16 modules done. I also learned about 2D and 3D transformations and about transitions.</p>
<p>This is all so cool! I can't wait to try them but for now I dont really have an idea how...</p>
<p>Let's see this:</p>
<img class="kirby" src="kirby-star.jpg">
<p>What do you think? Isn't it cute?? What else can I do with it?</p>
<p>I need to think more about it but I'm sure I'll get plenty of ideas!</p>
<p>Btw... do you like the new header?</p>
</div>
<div class="post">
<h3>27th February</h3>
<p>Another day of learning.</p>
<p>I just finished the second module of the CSS certification! 2/16 done!</p>
<p>When it comes to the "advanced CSS", I learned about text effects and web fonts.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I find text effects still a bit hard with all this word spacing and breaking and wrapping...</p>
<p>There is also something like a font-face rule that would let me use my own font.</p>
<p>How can I make my own font? It sounds cool, I guess?</p>
<p>I am feeling a bit sick so my learning capabilities could decrease a bit, sorry! But I am still trying hard, I swear.</p>
<p>Here's another song of the day because why not:</p>

<h3>23rd February</h3>
<p>I am a top super ladyyy~</p>
<p>I am so on fire recently. I started going through the modules for the CSS certification. Right now I am in the middle of the second one!</p>
<p>Today I've also learned about box-shadow and text-shadow properties. It's so fun. I feel like I can make so many things with it.</p>
<p>I thoguht it would be a good way to make flashcards, so here is my try:</p>
<div class="card" id="card"> Hi, how are you? </div>
<br>
<p>Previously I went through the chapter about gradients. They are placed using background-image property, hm.</p>
<p>I asked ChatGPT what the difference is when creating a picture with SVG and CSS gradient and there actually is some difference!</p>
<p>It's still better to use SVG though. Because when you resize, the quality of the pic is still good. It's also easier to edit because it's just code.</p> 
</div>
<div class="post">
<h3>12th February</h3>
<p>Hiiiii! Sorry for no info these days, but I have an update. Or several ones.</p>
<p>First of all, in the menu you can see a new link. I created a form.</p>
<p>I did it to practice making a form and to learn input types better.</p>
<p>It was a bit hard at first but after some time it definitely became way easier!</p>
<p>The input of my form is not sent anywhere tbh but I just wanted to practice the form of a form itself.</p>
<p>The second thing is.....</p>
<p>Yesterday (11.02.2024) I officially became an HTML developer! I got my first certification, scored 68 out of 70 points!</p>
<p>Now I can focus more on CSS and basics on JavaScript. It feels that I am really making a progress and getting closer and closer to my new life.</p>
</div>
<div class="post">
<h3>8th February</h3>
<p>Hello!</p>
<p>I need to admit that SVG is kinda fun when you practice a bit and know more or less what to do.</p>
<p>And it's fun experimenting with colours etc.</p>
<p>Here is my new picture:</p>
<svg height="200" width="300">
  <defs>
    <linearGradient id="grad1" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="80%" y2="40%">
      <stop offset="0%"
      style="stop-color:rgb(255,255,255);stop-opacity:1" />
      <stop offset="100%"
      style="stop-color:rgb(255,206,247);stop-opacity:1" />
    </linearGradient>
  </defs>
  <rect x="50" y="20" rx="30" ry="30" fill="url(#grad1)" width="180" height="180" />
  <text x="95" y="95" fill="#000000" font-size="35" font-family="Homemade Apple">Gigi's</text>
  <text x="80" y="145" fill="#000000" font-size="35" font-family="Homemade Apple">corner</text>
Sorry, your browser does not support inline SVG.
</svg>
<p>This time I tried to make a gradient. What do you think? It's like a small logo.</p>
<p>I also picked a new font. I wanted to use something that looks handwritten.</p>
<p>This page is like a diary for me, so using a handwritten font makes it look a bit more personal?</p>
<p>The more I practice, the less scary it is :) </p>
</div>
<div class="post">
<h3>6th February</h3>
<p>Hello!</p>
<p>I am getting closer and closer to the final certification test!</p>
<p>Now I am taking it slow and just practice code, especially things that I haven't tried yet.</p>
<p>One of them is drawing pictures.</p>
<p>Canvas are a bit to hard for me right now. Maybe I'll try another time?</p>
<p>For today I drew a heart. I hope it's nice as for my very first trial!</p>
<p>Here is how it started:</p>
<svg width="300" height="300">
  <polygon points="149,271 269,105 206,56 146,123 83,60 21,106" stroke-linejoin="round"
  style="fill:pink;stroke:purple;stroke-width:3;" />
Sorry, your browser does not support inline SVG.
</svg>
<p>And here is the final result:</p>
<svg width="300" height="300" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <path class="heart" d="M149,130 C88,56 21,105 42,164 L149,271 252,164 C269,105 206,56 149,130"
        fill="#FF97CA" stroke="purple" stroke-width="4"/>
Sorry, your browser does not support inline SVG.
</svg>
<p>What do you think? Try to hover on it too. It was so haaaaard but I am so proud that I did it by myself!</p>
<p>At first I used polygon points like in the W3Schools tutorial when they made a star. But then it turned out that I can't round the strokes and edges.</p>
<p>Apparently, radius attribute doesn't work with polygons. I had to find another way.</p>
<p>So ChatGPT told me about the path element and everything was a bit easier since then.</p>
<p>I'll practice SVGs a bit more maybe and then I'll work on forms.</p>
</div>
<div class="post">
<h3 id="February">1st February</h3>
<p>Don't think that I forgot again!</p>
<p>I am studying every day. I keep preparing for the certification and worked on the resources page a bit. Go and check out!</p>
<p>JavaScript is so hard... The explanations on W3Schools give me more confusion than clearity.</p>
<p>I am focusing now on understanding the most basic terminology. I'm asking ChatGPT many questions and taking notes.</p>
<p>I guess I need to look for a tutorial on YouTube "JavaScript for dummies" or something because I am so confused!</p>
</div>
<div class="post">
<h3>26th January</h3>
<p>Anothder day, another slay!</p>
<p>Almost lol I was trying to make this dropdown menu but it was so hard and there was something wrong all the time that I gave up.</p>
<p>I don't care enough about it for now.</p>
<p>Today I've learned about comments and syntax in JavaScript. So far, so good.</p>
<p>In my preparation for HTML certification, I came across the topic of the image map again.</p>
<p>I remember how confusing it was when I first learned about it months ago.</p>
<p>It doesn't seem so scary anymore, so here is my try:</p>
<img src="bird.png" alt="Little blue bird" usemap="#bird" style="width:150px;height:150px">
<map name="bird">
<area shape="circle" coords="55,84,52" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fJh2gIBOto">
</map>
<p>Is it working? Do you know the movie?</p>
</div>
<div class="post">
<h3>25th January</h3>
<p>Another day of learning CSS, JavaScript and preparing for HTML certification.</p>
<p>I'm thinking of organising this page a bit more maybe? Create a dropdown menu for each year?</p>
<p>My journey is getting longer and longer, and organising everything by months might create a chaos in the navigation bar in the future.</p>
<p>And I totally should finally start my resources page!</p>
<p>Fortunately, an idea for it is crystalising in my head. And I've found so many new resources and games for coding!</p>
<p>I'm excited to put everything in one place :) </p>
<p>Btw here is my new JavaScript attempt:</p>
<img id="kirby" src="kirby.png" alt="Kirby" style="width:100px;height:100px">
<button type="button" onclick="myFunction()">Click!</button>
<script>
function myFunction() {
document.getElementById("kirby").src="kirby-star.jpg"}
</script>
<p>What do you think? Isn't it cute?</p>
<p>I am slowly getting the gist of writing these functions but I definitely need more practice.</p>
</div>
<div class="post">
<h3>24th January</h3>
<p>I know I don't post here as often as before. Sorry!</p>
<p>But hopefully, I am back to regular posting. I am learning plenty of new things and I need to try them out here, hehe.</p>
<p>Some time ago I started with JavaScript. It's a bit complicated now but I will do my best anyway.</p>
<p>In the worst case, I'll ask ChatGPT tons of stupid questions and it'll have to deal with me, explaining one thing five times.</p>
<p>I decided to play a bit with media, so here is song of the day:</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/baaNwRAhHBo?si=hk_zAmrIFaQ0T7F8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Can you see it? If not, here a button:</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/baaNwRAhHBo?si=5vDUpASWl9G-7fsE" target="_blank" onclick="showPopup()">Wife by (G)I-DLE</a></p>
<script>
function showPopup() {
window.alert("Let's go!");}
</script>
<p>What do you think? It's a pre-release, the title track will be released soon.</p>
<p>I like the song for its message and sounding so silly at the same time.</p>
<p>The song is about society's expectations for women to be obedient wives who should only cook, clean and be good at sex.</p>
<p>The girls don't even lipsync the lyrics in the MV to show how women should stay quiet and only do their "duties".<p>
<pre>
<blockquote cite="https://youtu.be/baaNwRAhHBo?si=5vDUpASWl9G-7fsE">
I cook cream soup, taste is coco loco.
Want me as your wife, but she is umm, umm, umm.
I clean your room, it's so twinkle twinkle.
Want me as your wife, but she is umm, umm, umm.
</blockquote>
</pre>
<p>This part is so catchy for no reason, omg. But somewhere I've also read that it represents infantilisation of women and considering them stupid. Thus, the words <q>taste is coco loco</q> and <q>it's so twinkle, twinkle</q>.</p>
<p>Apparently, even the outfits symbolise something, but I am too lazy right now to write full explanation here XD</p>
<p>That's not why I write here anyway.</p>
</div>
<div class="post">
<h3 id="January">4th January</h3>
<p>Happy new year! My first post in the new year is here.</p>
<p>During that time I have been learning more about creating forms. But it's so complicated.</p>
<p>Well... for now I don't really see myself working on them. But maybe in the future?</p>
<p>I started learning for a certificate from W3Schools. I'm very motivated to get a high score!</p>
<p>The moment I pass it, I'll be officially in my IT era.</p>
<p>Another I've been wanting to do for some time already is creating a page with some interesting resources to learn coding that I've found so far.</p>
<p>I'm still thinking about the design though. I want to try something new but the page should still be coherent with this one, right?</p>
<p>Idk if I have anything else to say right now.</p>
<p>See you in the next post then! Bye!</p>
</div>
<div class="post">
<h3>21th December</h3>
<p>It's been long time since my last post. I was away for some time and I didn't take my laptop with me.</p>
<p>I am back now and still motivated. Writing these small entries gives me joy :) </p>
<p>It's almost Christmas but I will try to learn a bit everyday anywany.</p>
<p>Recently, I have been reading about Responsive Web Design and I am thinking what I can do to improve my website.</p>
<p>Today I have also learned about positioning. I think position: sticky is my favourite for now.</p>
<p>The rest is either too basic for me or too hard to understand XD</p>
<p>I have been watching some YouTube videos "A day in the life of a web developer/front-end developer etc." but damn...</p>
<p>These people really upload a 5 min video, show how they scroll Instagram or go to gym for 3/4 of the day and that's it?</p>
<p>I wanted to see what a typical day at work looks like, what tasks they usually need to do, and I found out completely nothing.</p>
</div>
<div class="post">
<h3>11th December</h3>
<p>Today, I've learned a bit about the <head> element and about layouts.</p>
<p>The part about layouts I found a bit hard but I'm sure it will be useful.</p>
<p>I've also started some JavaScript. But for this much anticipation, the chapter was a bit disappointing XD</p>
<p>It's ok though... I guess? I'll learn more with time and for now, I'll master what I have now.</p>
<p>Btw I created a small navigation menu and I finally understood how bookmarks work.</p>
<p>If you want to jump to an entry from a certain month, just use the navigation menu.</p>
<p>The menu will take you to the first entry from the month, you can see newer entries when you scroll up.</p>
</div>
<div class="post">
<h3>9th December</h3>
<p>Another day, another slay.</p>
<p>My beautiful table is fixed now and it makes me so happy!</p>
<p>We had to create a class called evening, add it to tr elements and then to kinda exclude th elements from the tr:hover thing, we just specified in the style sheet that th elements need to have a certain background and font colour.</p>
<p>I solved the problem that couldn't be solved even by chatGPT! You can call me an IT bitch now!</p>
<p>I'm so motivated now. I'll keep learning HTML and CSS, and soon I'll move to JavaScript.</p>
<p>The moment I start creating games, the industry will be over!</p>
</div>
<div class="post">
<h3>6th December</h3>
<p>Did you like tiny Kirby in the previous post? It's so cute, right? I didn't mean for it to be on the border but it looks so adorable. I'll keep it this way.</p>
<p>Yesterday I learned more about tables and I think now I feel ready to make one by myself.</p>
<p>I will show you my current skincare routine because I am forever in my skincare era:</p>

<p>Some of the rows are marked blue here. This colour means that I use the product in the evening and/or only a few times a week, not daily!</p>
<p>How is it? For some reason, I have problems with tr:hover thing... Only some of the rows change the colour when I hover, I have no idea how to fix it.</p>
</div>
<div class="post">
<h3 id="December">4th December</h3>
<p>New month, new challenges! I decided to move back to HTML since I couldn't really understand the topic about tables in CSS.</p>
<p>Idk, should I add one here? Maybe later!</p>
<p>Today I learned about creating an image map and a bit about the <picture> element.</p>
<p>I wanted to create an image map now but I realised that I have no idea how to find the coordinates on my pictures. What should I do?</p>
<p>Sometimes I find these tutorials a bit lacking... or too extensive for the level?</p>
<p>Why do they start mentioning JavaScript already when I'm still at the beginning of HTML and CSS tutorials?</p>
<p>Anyway... here is the promised button:</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/C-u5WLJ9Yk4?si=AakaUqoF32wc0uzi" target="_blank">Click!</a></p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>OMG now all links turned into buttons! Crazy. But it's ok :) <img src="kirby.png" alt="Kirby" style="width:100px;height:100px;float:right;"></p>
</div>
<div class="post">
<h3>29th November</h3>
<p>OMG! It's been a month since I started learnig HTML and CSS. I can't believe it. Time really flies. How is my progress? Did I learn a lot in one month?</p>
<p>I had a short trip to Wroclaw to visit Christmas market and the garden of lights. It was great but I am still sick :( </p>
<p>Anyway... I am back and learned new things!</p>
<p>On <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_link.asp">W3Schools</a>,  I read chapters about customising links, making buttons and about lists.</p>
<p>When I will be suddenly on motivation high, I'll add some buttons here. Although I don't know yet what I should even link here.</p>
<p>For now, I just wanted to write what I did today! So it looks like I'm a productive bitch.</p>
</div>
<div class="post">
<h3 style="border: 2px dashed purple;">26th November</h3>
<p>I'm visiting Christmas market in Wroclaw soon and I won't be able to learn or update here for a few days. That's why I am learning a lot now.</p>
<p>Today I learned about <span> element and it was exactly what I was looking for! I have been reading about google fonts and icons today. I had no idea that using icons can be kinda complicated lol...</p>
<p>I've started organising the code a bit as well... To be clear, I won't change the very first ones because this is how I started. Now I am improving and I hope you can see it in the lastest lines.</p>
<p>Anyway, I hope to have a lot of fun with google fonts and their effects. Especially the example with Sophia on fire is wild.</p>
<p>I don't have an idea yet on how to use icons for now. Maybe I should use them like emojis? Idk idk...</p>
</div>
<div class="post">
<h3 style="border: 2px dotted red;">25th November</h3>
<p>I was feeling terrible these past days but I am getting better. It's time for a new post on Gigi's corner.</p>
<p>I have learned a lot about formatting text and about fonts. I know what fallback fonts are and I am thinking on applying them here. I just need to learn how to use my super aesthetic fonts first before I decide on other totally basic fonts lol</p>
<p>Another interesting thing I learned is white-space property. I didn't get it at first but I asked ChatGPT and it explained me better.</p>
<p>Understanding font-variant: small-caps was also confusing. But now I kinda get it? Anyway, it seems that lora doesn't support it, I guess? So it's not use using it here.</p>
<p>What else should I write? I don't know, I feel like I don't make big progress. But I know that even small steps are important.</p>
<p>Damn, I don't like this background. I think I'll change it again.</p>
</div>
<div class="post">
<h3>20th November</h3>
<p>I thought I'm completely healed but today I feel sick again. My throat is hurting and I'm feeling so cold!</p>
<p>I'm not stopping thought and keep learning!</p>
<p>I just finished chapters about margins, padding, height and width, and learned what Box Model is.</p>
<p>I am still focusing on <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">W3Schools.</a> I am also reading a green book.</p>
<p>I changed the background of the website. Is it better now? I don't know anymore. Previous one was such bad quality but <em>cozy</em> in some way?</p>
<p>I tried making the borders a bit rounder. Does it look nicer now?</p>
</div>
<div class="post">
<h3>18th November</h3>
<p>I've just finished the chapter about CSS backgrounds and decided to play a bit with it.</p>
<p>I added a picture I found on google and set it as the background.</p>
<p>I tried to find a good quality picture but in the end, it looks so terrible??</p>
<p>Anyway, it was not so easy and I had to go back to the materials a few times. It's a good practice though!</p>
<p>I just don't have the slightest idea how I can keep practicing these? Should I make different backgrounds for each post?</p>
<p>Should I change the border for each post as well? But then setting the selector previously doesn't make much sense anymore...</p>
<p>I'll think about it.</p>
<p><b>PS.</b> I added a small bear gif at the top. Do you like it?</p>

<p>How is it looking now?</p>
<p>I decided to move to CSS for now. I find it interesting and I want to make my website pretty!</p>
<p>I'm thinking of adding a cozy silly picture as the background and making the posts a bit transparent like now.</p>
<p>There is a small break between the posts here because I was out and had no access to my laptop, so now I'm reviewing a bit.</p>
<p>Today's CSS chapter is about backgrounds. I know a bit from the HTML course already but it will help me refresh my memory and learn something new!</p>
<p>To be honest, I find CSS selectors a bit hard to understand, especially id selector, but I hope I learn using them with time.</p>
<p><b>Small update:</b> I've gone through background-color, background-image, background-position and background-repeat today.<br>
<b>Next time:</b> background-attachment and background shorthand property whatever that is!</p>

<h3>8th November</h3>
<p>Update: I guess I kinda figured it out? Does it look better now?</p>
<p>I tried to make the whole page look like this but it turned to be one huge mess! I don't know...</p>
</div>
<p style="border:2px solid Black; text-align:center; background-color:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5); font-family:lora;"> <b>7th November</b><br>Another entry after some time of absence. Yesterday evening I was reading about colours and borders. That's why this entry is made in this way. Do you like it?<br>
I just wish I knew how to make the border a bit shorter on the sides? Right now it's stretched on the whole page.<br>
Which way of writing entries is better? This one or the old one?<br>Now I feel like I can customise the shit out of this page, I'm such a <mark>profi</mark>!<br>
Another thing I need to learn: how to charge colours of some chosen letters within this one paragraph code?<br>
So far I think I'm doing <mark>good?</mark> Here I'm dropping meme of the day:<br>

<p style="background-color:white; text-align:center; font-family:cursive"><b>3rd November</b></p>
<p style="font-family:lora;">My third entry so far. Today I have learned about formatting.<br>However, I find certain elements a bit confusing. For example:</p>
<p style="font-family:lora;"><b>This sentence is bold and bald.</b><p>
<p style="font-family:lora;"><strong>And this one is super important. What's the difference? It looks the same.</strong></p>
<p style="font-family:lora;"><i>This sentence is Italian.</i></p>
<p style="font-family:lora;"><em>And this one is emphasised?</em></p>
<p style="font-family:lora;">Omg! <small>This sentence is so tiny!</small> It's not like other sentences.<mark>What a pick me.</mark></p>
<p style="font-family:lora;"> Ok, I am running out of <del>ideen</del><ins>ideas</ins> for <sup>these</sup><sub>sentences.</sub></p>
<p style="font-family:lora;">What should I write about? Should I keep making <mark>daddy jokes?</mark></p>
<p style="font-family:lora;">These entries are so chaotic omg but I don't know what else I should do to practice all of these.</p>
<p style="font-family:lora;">I think I might be able to finish reading <cite>Schwarze Magnolie</cite> by Hyeonseo Lee today.</p>

<p style="font-family:lora;">Next thing I have learned are quotations, like here:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://2l.pl/artykul-31268.html">
Koniec i bomba. A kto czytał ten trąba. W. G.
</blockquote>
<p style="font-family:lora;">And here I am inserting <q>quotation marks</q>.</p>
<p style="font-family:lora;">It's a lot of information at once but learning <abbr title="Hypertext Mark-up Language">HTML</abbr>is actually kinda fun! Btw...</p>
<bdo dir="rtl" style="font-family:lora;">Look at this crazy sentence lol</bdo>

<p style="font-family:lora;">This is my second entry while documenting my IT journey. Here is what I've learned today:</p>
<p style="color:blue;"> This sentence is blue.</p>
<p style="font-family:arial;"> This sentence is written with Arial font.</p>
<p style="font-size:200%; font-family:lora"> And this sentence is bigger. Isn't it?</p>
<p style="font-family:lora;">Move your mouse over the title of this page to see something.</p>
<p style="font-family:lora;">Here is a poem I have recently found:</p>
<pre>
Lubię, kiedy kobieta omdlewa w objęciu,
Kiedy w lubieżnym zwisa przez ramię przegięciu,
Gdy jej oczy zachodzą mgłą, twarz cała blednie,
I wargi się wilgotne rozchylą bezwiednie.

Lubię, kiedy ją rozkosz i żądza oniemi,
Gdy wpija się w ramiona palcami drżącemi,
Gdy krótkim, urywanym oddycha oddechem,
I oddaje się cała z mdlejącym uśmiechem. 

I lubię ten wstyd, co się kobiecie zabrania
Przyznać, że czuje rozkosz, że moc pożądania
Zwalcza ją, a sycenie żądzy oszalenia,
Gdy szuka ust, a lęka się słów i spojrzenia. 

Lubię to — i tę chwilę lubię, gdy koło mnie
Wyczerpana, zmęczona leży nieprzytomnie,
A myśl moja już od niej wybiega skrzydlata
W nieskończone przestrzenie nieziemskiego świata.
</pre>
<p style="font-family:lora;">It's written by one of my favourite Polish poets - Kazimierz Przerwa-Tetmajer.</p>
<p style="font-family:lora;">Currently vibing to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hz2aCKe8G8A">this song.</a> </p>
